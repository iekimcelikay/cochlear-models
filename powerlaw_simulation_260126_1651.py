# In this script ======
#   I will load the firing rates for each CF, which gives me the AN output.
#   Then I will apply power function, - imitates the sharpening of tuning curves
# after AN stages, in subcortical.
# I want to find the n that gives me an optimum sharpening profile.
# It might be interesting to compare this with a lateral inhibition operation
# Idk though.
# Checking different papers to identify the steps they apply after AN simulation
# can be a good idea.

# 1. Apply power function
# 2. Re-normalize (divide by pooled activity)
