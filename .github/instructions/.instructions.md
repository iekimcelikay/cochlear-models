# Project coding standards for Python
- Follow the PEP 8 style guide for Python.
- Always prioritize readability and clarity.
- Write clear and concise comments for each function.
- Be minimalistic with code; avoid unnecessary complexity.
- Ensure functions have descriptive names and include type hints.
- Maintain proper indentation (use 4 spaces for each level of indentation).
- Use docstrings to document modules, classes, and functions.   
- Limit lines to a maximum of 79 characters.
- Avoid using global variables; prefer passing parameters and returning values.
- Use list comprehensions and generator expressions where appropriate for better performance.
- Handle exceptions gracefully using try-except blocks.
- Use f-strings for string formatting (available in Python 3.6 and above).
- Regularly run linters (e.g., pylint, flake8) to ensure code quality.
- Write unit tests for critical functions to ensure code reliability.
- Use virtual environments to manage project dependencies.
- Keep imports organized: standard libraries first, followed by third-party libraries, and then local imports.
- Avoid using wildcard imports (e.g., from module import *).
- Use type hinting to improve code clarity and facilitate static analysis.
- Follow consistent naming conventions: use snake_case for functions and variables, PascalCase for classes.
- Avoid deep nesting of code; refactor into smaller functions if necessary.
- Regularly review and refactor code to improve efficiency and maintainability.

- Use logging instead of print statements for debugging and monitoring.

- Document the codebase thoroughly, including setup instructions and usage examples.
