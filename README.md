### TO DO:
- `folder_manager.py`: Change the folder naming structure. add the mincf and maxcf to folder name, because you will separate the CFs when running.
  You also need to modify the class call in the main run script.
  line 107 = freq_range is hard-coded (125,2500, num_cf)
  Parametrize the min_cf & max_cf
  take that variable into a init parameter of the class FolderManager
