https://github.com/iekimcelikay/cochlea.git install cochlea py3-zilany2014 from here. 
## Installing `cochlea` (zilany2014 model) on dIPC Servers

### 1. Clone the `py3-zilany2014` branch into your project

```bash
git clone --branch py3-zilany2014 https://github.com/iekimcelikay/cochlea.git /scratch/<username>/workspace/auditory-pRF-subcortical/zilany2014
```

### 2. Add a `pyproject.toml` to the cloned directory

The package uses Cython extensions. Modern `pip` creates isolated build environments that don't have access to your conda environment's packages, so we need to explicitly declare the build dependencies.

```bash
cd /scratch/<username>/workspace/auditory-pRF-subcortical/zilany2014
```

Create a `pyproject.toml` file with the following content:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools", "Cython", "numpy"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

### 3. Install in editable mode

Make sure your conda environment is activated, then run:

```bash
pip install -e . --no-build-isolation
```

The `--no-build-isolation` flag is needed to prevent `pip` from spawning an isolated subprocess that doesn't have access to your environment's Cython installation.

### Notes
- Tested with Python 3.9, Cython 3.2.4, setuptools 80.9.0
- A C compiler (`gcc`) must be available on the system (it is on dIPC servers)
- The editable install means any changes to the source code in `zilany2014/` are immediately reflected without reinstalling

## IMPORTANT:
- If a file has a date in its name e.g. `280126` it means (in most cases) it is my working script. This does not entail that I won't make changes in the other scripts, but the others are more likely to be stable. The ones with the dates are the ones I'm currently working on to do some new stuff. 
- You need to run the script in project root for the imports to work. In the future, this may be converted into a proper package. For now, it's modules. 
- Use the cochlea package in this repo, its' Zilany2014 model codes are updated for Python 3.
- To make thorns work in Python3, these changes might be needed:
-> replace `import imp` with `import importlib as imp`
-> replace `from collections` with `collections.abc
